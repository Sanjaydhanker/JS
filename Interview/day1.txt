JavaScript Interview Questions – Day 1 (Basic Level)
1. What is JavaScript, and why is it used?

Answer:
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used to make websites interactive, dynamic, and responsive.

Runs in the browser as well as on the server (via Node.js).

Handles events, form validation, animations, and API requests.

It’s the core language for the MERN stack.

2. What are the different data types in JavaScript?

Answer:
JavaScript has 8 main data types:
Primitive Types:

String → "Hello"

Number → 25

Boolean → true / false

Null → null

Undefined → let x;

Symbol → Symbol("id")

BigInt → 12345678901234567890n
Non-Primitive Type:

Object → { name: "Sanjay" }

3. What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Feature	var	let	const
Scope	Function-scoped	Block-scoped	Block-scoped
Re-declare	✅ Allowed	❌ Not allowed	❌ Not allowed
Re-assign	✅ Allowed	✅ Allowed	❌ Not allowed
Hoisting	✅ Hoisted (undefined)	✅ Hoisted (but TDZ*)	✅ Hoisted (but TDZ*)

TDZ = Temporal Dead Zone → Variable exists but can’t be used before declaration.

4. What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?

Answer:

== (Loose Equality): Compares values only → does type conversion.

=== (Strict Equality): Compares values + data types.

Example:

console.log(5 == "5");   // true  (type conversion)
console.log(5 === "5");  // false (different types)

5. What are JavaScript functions?

Answer:
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.

Types of Functions:

Function Declaration

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, Sanjay!");
}
greet();


Function Expression

const greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello, Sanjay!");
}
greet();


Arrow Function (ES6)

const greet = () => console.log("Hello, Sanjay!");
greet();
